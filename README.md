👋 Hi, I’m @nikrangerdejan
👀 I’m interested in how Google's search algorithms work, especially the snippet ranking system and the factors that influence content visibility and click-through rates.
🌱 I’m currently learning about the different modules and signals involved in crawling, indexing, ranking, and displaying search results, drawing insights from internal protobuf definitions.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve analysing and interpreting these definitions to uncover the hidden mechanisms behind Google's search results, creating experiments based on data based hypothesis and sharing results.
